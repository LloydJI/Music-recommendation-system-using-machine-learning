# Music-recommendation-system-using-machine-learning
#In this project, I built a music recommendation system by analyzing song genres and grouping them into multiple groups based on analysis. The #system will be able to recommend a certain number of songs to users according to their musical preferences. To group genres into segments based on their #similarities, an unsupervised learning algorithm can be used to determine both the number of groups and genres in each group because the data is not #labeled. An unsupervised algorithm will model the distribution or underlying structure of the data and learn the hidden relationships in the data. After #completing this step, supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms can be used to classify which genre belong to the unseen songs. A technical #(categorical) label is used for this data set. This new label can then be thought of as the target label that the supervised/unsupervised algorithm #should use to learn a mapping function between it that allows it to predict the target variable from the input variables.
